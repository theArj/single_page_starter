          <h2>History of the Loudness War</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever listened to song that amped you up, or made you cry?
            What was it about the song that moved you so much? Was it the
            singer, the beat, the music, your headphones? How about songs that
            you don't like? So many factors contribute to the listening
            experience. But, as a formally trained audio engineer, I can say
            that even a well-written song, sung by a phenomenal singer, with
            some of the best musicians on the track can still fall victim to the
            consequences of the "Loudness War" and make listening quite
            unpleasant. But most people are unaware of the Loudness War and the
            artistic havoc it's wreaked on society, and how it affects them.
            Let's examine one big reason why music can inspire or irritate,
            coming from an industry insider. The answer might surprise you!
          </p>
          <p>
            Before delving into the
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ"
              target="_blank"
              >Loudness War</a
            >, here is a small disclaimer. Audio engineers are notorious for
            getting technical, like discussing dynamic range,
            <abbr>dBVU</abbr> v. <abbr>dBFS</abbr>, microphone placement and the
            science behind wave propagation, etc. Stick with me, and I'll
            explain these simple concepts with complex-sounding names. But
            beware, you may never to listen to music the same way again. Take
            the red pill at your own risk! Ready? Here we go!
          </p>
          <p>
            First, let's go back in history, when music was recorded (or
            "tracked") using analog gear, such as large format recording
            consoles with lots of electronics, mechanical reel-to-reel tape
            machines that captured audio on magnetic tape, outboard equipment,
            such as compressors, equalizers, reverb units, etc. This gear shaped
            the sound to create a final mastered track, with the signature
            saturated "warm" analog quality that's characteristic of vinyl
            records, 8-track, or cassette tapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When computers became more powerful, a new medium appeared in the
            early 1980s in the form of digital audio stored on Compact Discs
            <abbr>(CDs)</abbr>. No expensive bulky mechanical tape machine was
            needed, but rather computer software that recorded nearly unlimited
            audio in the form of digital binary code (0s and 1s) onto hard
            drives. <abbr>CDs</abbr> provided a "cleaner" signal, without the
            pops and clicks of vinyl records, and could be easily produced and
            distributed without signal degredation, unlike magnetic tape. It was
            cheaper to record and mix on a computer with plugin emulations.
            Analog gear is expensive, difficult to maintain, and requires lots
            of space to store. Many large commercial studios still use some
            analog gear, but rarely ever 2-inch reel-to-reel Studer or Otari
            tape machines. Instead, most studios traded tape machines for hard
            drives, and use Digital Audio Workstations <abbr>DAWs</abbr>, such
            as
            <a href="https://www.avid.com/en/pro-tools" target="_blank"
              >Avid Pro Tools</a

            to record and mix audio. But no one expected the shift from analog
            to digital audio to signal one of the worst wars on artistic
            expression. Let's examine some of the differences between analog and
            digital audio to get some context on the Loudness War.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital audio and analog audio have some big differences. First,
            analog loudness is measured using decibels volume units
            <abbr>(dBVU)</abbr>, while digital audio is measured using decibels
            full scale <abbr>(dBFS)</abbr>. We'll get to the differences between
            the two measurements in a second. Analog gear, such as vacuum tubes
            in guitar amplifiers, or tape machines, impart harmonics that create
            a type of saturation that gives it that "warm" thick sound that you
            hear on most music before the 1990s. Recording engineers would often
            "push" a track's recording level going to tape just a decibel
            <abbr>(dB)</abbr> or two over the 0<abbr>dBVU</abbr> mark on the
            meter to create the coveted analog "warmth." But this is not the
            case when it comes to digital audio. Digital audio cannot go over
            the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark. You cannot "push" a digital track
            beyond its maximum paramenters like you can with analog audio
            equipment. When a digital audio signal hits, or tries to go past the
            0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark on the track's meter, it will create what is
            called "<a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUDl2lohcv4"
              target="_blank"
              >clipping</a
            >", which results in a very distorted signal. Once a signal being
            recorded clips, it can't be undone! It's gone forever! Analog gear
            is much more forgiving when it comes to pushing levels going to
            tape. If the recording levels were perfect, but a mixing or
            mastering engineer boosted levels to the point of clipping during
            the mixing stage, then at least that is correctable with a remix.
            It's vital to set digital audio levels properly to prevent clipping
            the audio no matter which stage in the creative process. A great way
            to remember to keep your signal in the healthy dynamic range is to
            remember that the analog 0<abbr>(dBVU)</abbr>
            is equivalent to the digital -18<abbr>dbFS</abbr>, with a maximum
            peak of -6<abbr>dbFS</abbr>. This will provide enough headroom for
            adding effects, such as compression, equilization, reverb, delay,
            etc. without overloading the master stereo output during the mixing
            stage. What proper levels also provide is more spatial placement
            recognition. For example, when you pan the guitar to the left, you
            will be better able to hear it as such more clearly than a
            hypercompressed mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we got all of that technical jargon out of the way, let's
            see how the Loudness War came about. With the introduction of
            digital audio, record labels noticed that digital audio could be
            made louder through compression and limiting. After all, why should
            a record label allow their competitor's albums to sound louder than
            theirs? So, the labels began demanding mastering engineers, who
            polish and arrange the songs, to make albums that sounded louder,
            and to get it as close to the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr>
            mark as possible. At first, this may sound harmless. Music always
            sounds better when played louder, right? Not always.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many record label business executives do not have extensive
            on-the-ground experience in the studio, producing, mixing and
            mastering music. As a business, a record label makes decisions that
            affect profit, while musicians and studio personnel mostly work
            towards artistic expression. A successful mastering engineer with 30
            years of experience has highly tuned ears, techincal mastery over
            his or her gear, and knows what it takes to create a hit record from
            the artistic standpoint. When business executives from record labels
            stepped in and began making decisions normally relegated to the
            studio experts, thus began the
            <a

              >Loudness War</a
            >. Think of it as the investors of a private hospital telling the
            doctors how to treat patients in order to maximize their own
            profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in the 1980s, the digital waveform of a stereo track contained
            prominent peaks and dips, indicating broad dynamic range, room for
            the track to breathe, punchier transients, and much better spatial
            placement awareness of the elements in the track, such as vocals,
            instruments, effects, etc. Over time, <abbr>CDs</abbr> became louder
            and louder, leading to what is known as "hypercompression". Despite
            prominent
            <a
              href="https://tapeop.com/interviews/116/bob-katz-bonus/"
              target="_blank"
              >audio engineers</a
            >
            speaking out about the effects of hypercompression, record labels
            continued to insist on "louder" tracks. "Remastered" versions of
            classic albums hit the market. But something awful was happening...
          </p>
          <p>
            While audio engineers protested behind the scenes, the public was
            blissfully unaware of the longterm effects of listening to
            hypercompressed music. Many noticed ear fatigue, but could not
            explain why. Others were unable to clearly identify instruments that
            once sat in their own frequency pockets because of the gigantic
            hypercompressed wall of sound blaring through their earpods or
            speakers. Others expressed a general dislike for "music today". What
            is a remedy to this problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of <abbr>mp3s</abbr> and other lossy digital
            formats that removed data from a digital audio file in favor of a
            smaller file size, it had an interesting effect. When creating an
            <abbr>mp3s</abbr> from a well mixed <abbr>CD</abbr>, the amount of
            discarded information can be audible. But when creating an mp3 from
            a hypercompressed <abbr>CD</abbr>, the result can actually be closer
            to an early <abbr>CD</abbr> because of the amount of data that
            <abbr>mp3s</abbr> remove from a track. The thick waveforms of
            hypercompressed music tended to be less obvious, although clipping
            still cannot be corrected. However, this is nowhere near a remedy to
            the Loudness War.
          </p>
          <p>
            But hope is not lost! Over the past few years, after much debate,
            and audio engineers raising awareness, songs are now being mastered
            with increased dynamic range. With the resurgence of vinyl records
            among young listeners, comes education in why music sounded so full
            of life, with lots of punch and clarity on those old records. The
            music industry has forever changed. With more artists creating
            tracks at home and bypassing record labels, the artist is more free
            to choose the medium and platform to release their work.

            are now normalizing their audio to a more reasonable level. After
            nearly a 20-year war, with countless tracks falling victim, enough
            voices were raised to make a change. In fact, Bob Katz, a renouned
            audio engineer recently noted that we may have finally ended the
