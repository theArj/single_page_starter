				<h2>What Is the "Loudness War"?</h2>
			</div>

			<body>
				<p>
					Have you ever listened to song that just amped you up, or made you
					cry? What was it about the song that moved you so deeply? Was it the
					beat, the singer, or that blazing guitar solo? Was it the pair of
					headphones you were listening on? All of these factors contribute to
					the listening experience. But, as a formally trained audio engineer, 
					I can tell you that a well-written song, sung by a phenomenal singer, 
					with some of the best musicians on the track can still fall victim to
					the effects of the "Loudness War".
				</p>
				<p>
					To know what the
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ">Loudness War</a>
					is all about, we first have to go back in history, when music was
					recorded (or "tracked") using analog gear, such as large format
					consoles with lots of electronics, mechanical reel-to-reel tape
					machines that captured audio, outboard equipment, such as
					compressors and limiters, equalizers, etc. This gear modified the
					sound to create a final mastered track, with the signature "warm"
					analog quality that the public would buy in the form of vinyl
					records, 8-track, or cassette tapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					When computers became more powerful, a new medium began appearing in
					the early 1980s in the form of digital audio stored on Compact discs
					<abbr>(CDs)</abbr>. <abbr>CDs</abbr> provided a "cleaner" signal,
					without the pops and clicks of vinyl records, and could be easily
					produced and distributed without signal degredation. It was cheaper
					to record and mix on a computer, since analog tape and gear are
					expensive, difficult to maintain, and takes quite a bit of room to
					store. Large studios still use analog outboard gear, but rarely ever
					a 2-inch reel-to-reel Studer or Otari tape machine. Instead, most
					studios transitioned to digital audio workstations
					<abbr>DAWs</abbr>, such as Avid Pro Tools or Apple Logic Pro.
					However, this analog to digital tradeoff comes at a cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Audio engineers are notorious for getting technical, discussing
					dynamic range, <abbr>dBVU</abbr>, spatial placement, etc. Bear with
					me, as I explain these simple concepts with complex-sounding names,
					and I'll take you on a journey that may cause you never to listen to
					music the same way. This has its pros and cons, so take the red pill
					at your own risk!
				</p>
				<p>
					Digital audio and analog audio have some big differences. First,
					analog loudness is measured using decibels volume units
					<abbr>(dBVU)</abbr>, while digital audio is measured using decibels
					full scale <abbr>(dBFS)</abbr>. We'll get to the differences here in
					a second. Analog gear, such as vacuum tubes on guitar amplifiers, or
					tape machines, impart harmonics that create a type of saturation
					that gives it that "warm" thick sound that you hear on most music
					before the 1990s. Recording engineers would often "drive" a track a
					decibel <abbr>(dB)</abbr> or two over the 0<abbr>dBVU</abbr> mark on
					the meter. Audio engineers can push a kick drum or electric guitar
					track just a bit to create this "warmth." But this is not so when it
					comes to digital audio. Digital audio cannot go over
					0<abbr>dbFS</abbr>. When a digital audio signal hits, or tries to go
					past the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark on the track's meter, it will
					create what is called "clipping," which results in a very distorted
					signal. It is vital to set digital audio levels to prevent clipping
					the audio. A great way to remember to keep your signal in the
					healthy range is to remember that the analog 0<abbr>(dBVU)</abbr> is
					equivalent to the digital -18<abbr>dbFS</abbr>, with a maximum peak
					of -6<abbr>dbFS</abbr>. This will provide enough headroom for adding
					effects, such as compression, equilization, reverb, delay, etc.
					without overloading the master stereo output during the mixing
					stage. What proper levels also provide is more spatial placement
					recognition. For example, when you pan the guitar to the left, you
					will be better able to hear it as such.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that we got all of that technical jargon out of the way, let's
					see how these Loudness War came about. With the introduction of
					digital audio, record labels noticed that digital audio could be
					made louder through compression. After all, why should a record
					label allow their competitor's albums to sound louder than theirs?
					So, the labels began requesting mastering engineers, who polished
					the songs and arranged the album, to make albums that sounded
					louder, and to get it as close to the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark as
					possible. At first, this may sound harmless. Music always sounds
					better when played louder, right? Not always...
				</p>
				<p>
					Many record label executives do not necessarily have on-the-ground
					experience in the studio, producing, mixing and mastering music. As
					a business, a record label makes decisions that affect profit, while
					musicians and studio personnel mostly work towards artistic
					expression. A successful mastering engineer with 30 years of
					experience has highly tuned ears, techincal mastery over his or her
					gear, and knows what it takes to create a hit record from the
					artistic standpoint. When business executives from record labels
					stepped in and began making decisions normally relegated to the
					studio experts, thus began the
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL13b9hCYjc">Loudness War</a>. Think of it as the investors
					of a private hospital telling the
					doctors how to treat patients in order to maximize their profits.
				</p>
				<p>
					Early in the 1980s, the digital waveform of a stereo track contained
					prominent peaks and dips, indicating broad dynamic range, room for
					the track to breathe, and much better spatial placement awareness of
					the elements in the track, such as vocals, instruments, effects,
					etc. Over time, <abbr>CDs</abbr> became louder and louder, leading
					to what is known as "hypercompression". Despite mastering engineers
					speaking out about the effects of hypercompression, record labels
					continued to insist on "louder" tracks. "Remastered" versions of
					classic albums hit the market. But something awful was happening...
				</p>
				<p>
					While audio engineers protested behind the scenes, the public was
					blissfully unaware of the longterm effects of listening to
					hypercompressed music can cause. Many noticed ear fatigue, but could
					not explain why. Others were unable to clearly hear instruments that
					once sat in their own frequency pockets because of the gigantic
					hypercompressed wall of sound blaring through their earpods or
					speakers. Others expressed a general dislike for "music today". What
					is a remedy to this problem?
				</p>
				<p>
					With the introduction of <abbr>mp3s</abbr> and other lossy digital
					formats that removed data from a digital audio file in favor of a
					smaller file size, it had an interesting effect. When creating an
					<abbr>mp3s</abbr> from an old <abbr>CD</abbr>, the amount of
					discarded information can be audible. But when creating an mp3 from
					a hypercompressed <abbr>CD</abbr>, the result can actually be closer
					to an early <abbr>CD</abbr> because of the amount of data that
					<abbr>mp3s</abbr> remove from a track containing an unnecessary
					amount of sound data. Although, this is nowhere near a remedy to the
					problem of hypercompression and Loudness War.

				<h2>Tools to Combat Loudness War</h2>
				<p>
					The Loudness War has taken a toll on many audio engineers,
					musicians, and listeners. Although there may not be anything that
					the general public can do to combat the Loudness War, there are
					steps that indie artists, poducers, and engineers can take. But they
					first need the tools to act.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many <abbr>DAWs</abbr> now come with metering that monitors the mix
					to warn the engineer when reaching levels that could lead to a
					hypercompressed track. For example, Apple's
					<a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a> comes
					stock with a
					<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH27842?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US">Multimeter</a>
					that also displays
					<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH27232?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US">loudness</a>
					through LUFS meters on the right. Engineers can instantiate the
					Multimeter plugin on the master stereo output track to keep an eye
					on the overall levels. A marker at the -12<abbr>dBFS</abbr>
					indicates the recommended maximum level for a dynamic mix.
				</p>
				<p>
					Brainworx also makes a dynamic range meter called, the
					<a href="https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/bx_meter.html">Brainworx bx_meter</a>
					that does a similar job.
