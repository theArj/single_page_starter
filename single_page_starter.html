          <h2>History of the Loudness War</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever listened to song that just amped you up, or made you
            cry? What was it about the song that moved you so deeply? Was it the
            beat, the singer, or that blazing guitar solo? Was it the pair of
            headphones you were listening on? All of these factors contribute to
            the listening experience. But, as a formally trained audio engineer,
            with more than ten years of experience, I can tell you that a
            well-written song, sung by a phenomenal singer, with some of the
            best musicians on the track can still fall victim to the effects of
            the "Loudness War".
          </p>
          <p>
            Before delving into the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ"
              >Loudness War</a
            >, we first have to go back in history, when music was
            recorded (or "tracked") using analog gear, such as large format
            recording consoles with lots of electronics, mechanical reel-to-reel tape
            machines that captured audio, outboard equipment, such as
            compressors and limiters, equalizers, etc. This gear modified the
            sound to create a final mastered track, with the signature "warm"
            analog quality that the public would buy in the form of vinyl
            records, 8-track, or cassette tapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When computers became more powerful, a new medium began appearing in
            the early 1980s in the form of digital audio stored on Compact discs
            <abbr>(CDs)</abbr>. <abbr>CDs</abbr> provided a "cleaner" signal,
            without the pops and clicks of vinyl records, and could be easily
            produced and distributed without signal degredation. It was cheaper
            to record and mix on a computer, since analog tape and gear are
            expensive, difficult to maintain, and takes quite a bit of room to
            store. Large studios still use analog outboard gear, but rarely ever
            a 2-inch reel-to-reel Studer or Otari tape machine. Instead, most
            studios transitioned to digital audio workstations
            <abbr>DAWs</abbr>, such as Avid Pro Tools or Apple Logic Pro.
            However, this analog to digital tradeoff comes at a cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Audio engineers are notorious for getting technical, discussing
            dynamic range, <abbr>dBVU</abbr>, spatial placement, etc. Bear with
            me, as I explain these simple concepts with complex-sounding names,
            and I'll take you on a journey that may cause you never to listen to
            music the same way. This has its pros and cons, so take the red pill
            at your own risk!
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital audio and analog audio have some big differences. First,
            analog loudness is measured using decibels volume units
            <abbr>(dBVU)</abbr>, while digital audio is measured using decibels
            full scale <abbr>(dBFS)</abbr>. We'll get to the differences here in
            a second. Analog gear, such as vacuum tubes on guitar amplifiers, or
            tape machines, impart harmonics that create a type of saturation
            that gives it that "warm" thick sound that you hear on most music
            before the 1990s. Recording engineers would often "drive" a track a
            decibel <abbr>(dB)</abbr> or two over the 0<abbr>dBVU</abbr> mark on
            the meter. Audio engineers can push a kick drum or electric guitar
            track just a bit to create this "warmth." But this is not so when it
            comes to digital audio. Digital audio cannot go over
            0<abbr>dbFS</abbr>. When a digital audio signal hits, or tries to go
            past the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark on the track's meter, it will
            create what is called "clipping," which results in a very distorted
            signal. It is vital to set digital audio levels to prevent clipping
            the audio. A great way to remember to keep your signal in the
            healthy range is to remember that the analog 0<abbr>(dBVU)</abbr> is
            equivalent to the digital -18<abbr>dbFS</abbr>, with a maximum peak
            of -6<abbr>dbFS</abbr>. This will provide enough headroom for adding
            effects, such as compression, equilization, reverb, delay, etc.
            without overloading the master stereo output during the mixing
            stage. What proper levels also provide is more spatial placement
            recognition. For example, when you pan the guitar to the left, you
            will be better able to hear it as such.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we got all of that technical jargon out of the way, let's
            see how these Loudness War came about. With the introduction of
            digital audio, record labels noticed that digital audio could be
            made louder through compression. After all, why should a record
            label allow their competitor's albums to sound louder than theirs?
            So, the labels began requesting mastering engineers, who polished
            the songs and arranged the album, to make albums that sounded
            louder, and to get it as close to the 0<abbr>dbFS</abbr> mark as
            possible. At first, this may sound harmless. Music always sounds
            better when played louder, right? Not always...
          </p>
          <p>
            Many record label executives do not necessarily have on-the-ground
            experience in the studio, producing, mixing and mastering music. As
            a business, a record label makes decisions that affect profit, while
            musicians and studio personnel mostly work towards artistic
            expression. A successful mastering engineer with 30 years of
            experience has highly tuned ears, techincal mastery over his or her
            gear, and knows what it takes to create a hit record from the
            artistic standpoint. When business executives from record labels
            stepped in and began making decisions normally relegated to the
            studio experts, thus began the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL13b9hCYjc"
              >Loudness War</a
            >. Think of it as the investors of a private hospital telling the
            doctors how to treat patients in order to maximize their profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early in the 1980s, the digital waveform of a stereo track contained
            prominent peaks and dips, indicating broad dynamic range, room for
            the track to breathe, and much better spatial placement awareness of
            the elements in the track, such as vocals, instruments, effects,
            etc. Over time, <abbr>CDs</abbr> became louder and louder, leading
            to what is known as "hypercompression". Despite mastering engineers
            speaking out about the effects of hypercompression, record labels
            continued to insist on "louder" tracks. "Remastered" versions of
            classic albums hit the market. But something awful was happening...
          </p>
          <p>
            While audio engineers protested behind the scenes, the public was
            blissfully unaware of the longterm effects of listening to
            hypercompressed music can cause. Many noticed ear fatigue, but could
            not explain why. Others were unable to clearly hear instruments that
            once sat in their own frequency pockets because of the gigantic
            hypercompressed wall of sound blaring through their earpods or
            speakers. Others expressed a general dislike for "music today". What
            is a remedy to this problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of <abbr>mp3s</abbr> and other lossy digital
            formats that removed data from a digital audio file in favor of a
            smaller file size, it had an interesting effect. When creating an
            <abbr>mp3s</abbr> from an old <abbr>CD</abbr>, the amount of
            discarded information can be audible. But when creating an mp3 from
            a hypercompressed <abbr>CD</abbr>, the result can actually be closer
            to an early <abbr>CD</abbr> because of the amount of data that
            <abbr>mp3s</abbr> remove from a track containing an unnecessary
            amount of sound data. Although, this is nowhere near a remedy to the
            problem of hypercompression and Loudness War.
          </p>
          <p>
            But hope is not lost! Over the past few years, after much debate, songs
            are now being mastered with increased dynamic range. With a resurgence
            in vinyl records among young listeners, comes education in why music 
            sounded so full of life, with lots of punch and clarity on those old
            records. The music industry has forever changed. With more artists creating
            tracks at home and bypassing record labels, the artist is more free to choose
            the medium and platform to release their work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war#2020s"
            >Major streaming services</a> are now normalizing their audio to a more 
            reasonable level. We may have finally ended the <em>Great Loudness War</em> of the 
            21<sup>st</sup> century!
